  "title": "How to create an NFT collection with utility beyond just JPEGs?",
  "content": "I want to launch an NFT collection but I'm tired of the 'just expensive JPEGs' criticism. Looking to add real utility and value.\n\n**Collection Concept:**\n- 5,000 unique characters\n- Each NFT grants access to exclusive features\n- Built on Ethereum mainnet\n\n**Utility Ideas I'm Considering:**\n1. **Staking rewards** - Holders earn tokens over time\n2. **Governance** - Vote on project direction\n3. **Game integration** - Use NFTs as playable characters\n4. **IRL events** - Exclusive meetups and conferences\n5. **Commercial rights** - Holders can commercialize their NFT\n\n**Technical Questions:**\n1. How do I implement staking rewards for NFT holders?\n2. Best way to verify NFT ownership for off-chain utilities?\n3. Should I use ERC-721A for gas optimization?\n4. How to handle metadata updates for evolving NFTs?\n5. Smart contract security best practices for NFTs?\n\n**Business Questions:**\n1. What utility features actually increase long-term value?\n2. How to avoid legal issues with governance tokens?\n3. Sustainable tokenomics for staking rewards?\n\nLooking for both technical implementation advice and business strategy insights!",
