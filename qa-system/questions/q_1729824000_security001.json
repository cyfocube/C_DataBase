  "content": "My Ledger Nano S Plus shows a transaction I never authorized. $2,300 USDC moved from my wallet 6 hours ago, but I haven't used the device in 2 days.\n\n**Transaction details:**\n- From: 0x742d35Cc6665C0532FCaB0BF5d59...6F7 (my address)\n- To: 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890 (unknown)\n- Amount: 2,300 USDC\n- TX Hash: 0xabc123...def456\n- Gas: 21,000 (standard transfer)\n- Timestamp: 6 hours ago\n\n**Security check:**\n- ✅ Ledger device never left my possession\n- ✅ Seed phrase stored offline, never digital\n- ✅ No malware detected (full system scan)\n- ✅ Used only official Ledger Live app\n- ❓ Connected to MetaMask for DeFi (could this be the issue?)\n\n**Concerns:**\n1. How can funds move without physical device approval?\n2. Is MetaMask integration a security risk?\n3. Could this be a pre-authorized transaction I forgot about?\n4. Should I move remaining funds immediately?\n\n**Remaining assets:**\n- 0.5 ETH (~$825)\n- 1,200 USDT\n- Various small altcoins\n\nI'm panicking - is my hardware wallet compromised or am I missing something obvious? Never had this happen before.",
