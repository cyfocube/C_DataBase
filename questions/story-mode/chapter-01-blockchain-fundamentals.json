      "id": "immutability-concept",
      "question": "Why is blockchain considered immutable?",
      "options": [
        "Because it's stored on the internet",

        "Because it's monitored by governments"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Each block's hash depends on the previous block, so changing any block would require recalculating all subsequent blocks.",
