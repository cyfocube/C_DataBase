  "content": "Alternative perspective here - I'd actually suggest starting with **Trezor One** ($69) over Ledger:\n\n## Why Trezor One for Beginners:\n\n**✅ Pros:**\n- Fully open-source (you can audit the code)\n- No proprietary secure element - more transparent\n- Excellent documentation and community\n- Physical buttons (harder to hack than touchscreens)\n- SatoshiLabs has never had a major security breach\n\n**❌ Cons:**\n- Supports fewer cryptocurrencies than Ledger\n- Interface is more basic\n- No mobile app (desktop only)\n\n## The Ledger Controversy You Should Know:\n\n**2020 Data Breach:**\n- 270,000+ customer addresses/phone numbers leaked\n- People got targeted for $5 wrench attacks\n- **Your crypto was safe, but your privacy wasn't**\n\nLedger's security is still excellent for crypto storage, but this privacy issue is real.\n\n## My Beginner Recommendation:\n\n**If privacy is important to you:** Trezor One ($69)\n**If you want maximum coin support:** Ledger Nano S Plus ($79)\n\n**Both are excellent choices** - you really can't go wrong either way.\n\n## Pro Tips for Any Hardware Wallet:\n\n1. **Buy directly from manufacturer** - never Amazon/eBay\n2. **Check tamper seals** when it arrives\n3. **Generate new seed** even if one comes with device\n4. **Test with small amounts first**\n5. **Consider getting 2** (one as backup)\n\n@CryptoMentor's strategy is solid - start with free software wallet, then upgrade to hardware once you're comfortable.",
