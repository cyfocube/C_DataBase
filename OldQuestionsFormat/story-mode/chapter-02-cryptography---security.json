      "question": "What's the main difference between symmetric and asymmetric cryptography?",
      "options": [
        "Symmetric is faster, asymmetric is more secure",
        "Symmetric uses one key for both encryption/decryption, asymmetric uses key pairs",
        "Symmetric is newer technology",
        "There is no difference"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Symmetric cryptography uses the same key for encryption and decryption, while asymmetric uses a public-private key pair.",
