  "title": "MakerDAO DSR vs Compound V3 USDC - which is safer for $500k?",
  "content": "I need to park $500k USDC for 6-12 months and considering these options:\n\n**MakerDAO DSR (Dai Savings Rate):**\n- Current rate: 5.00% APY\n- Need to convert USDC â†’ DAI first\n- Risk: DAI depeg, MakerDAO governance changes\n- Liquidity: Instant withdrawal\n\n**Compound V3 USDC:**\n- Current rate: 4.2% APY\n- Native USDC, no conversion needed\n- Risk: Compound protocol risk, liquidation (though I'm only supplying)\n- Liquidity: Instant withdrawal\n\n**My concerns:**\n1. **DAI stability**: SVB collapse showed stablecoin risks. Is DAI's $1 peg reliable for large amounts?\n2. **Protocol risk**: Compound has been around longer, but MakerDAO has larger TVL\n3. **Governance**: Both are governed by token holders - which is more stable?\n4. **Regulatory risk**: Any compliance differences for US entities?\n\nI'm leaning toward Compound for simplicity (no DAI conversion) but DSR rate is tempting. For this amount and timeframe, what would you choose and why?\n\n*This is for a US LLC treasury management, so regulatory compliance matters.*",
