  "content": "Thanks @CryptoMentor and @SecurityFirst! This is exactly what I needed.\n\nQuick question - you both mentioned starting with MetaMask first. Is there a risk of getting hacked while learning? Should I use a separate computer or anything special?\n\nAlso, when you say \"start small\" - what's a reasonable amount to practice with? I don't want to lose money but also want to get real experience.\n\nFinally, dumb question but - if I buy a hardware wallet, can I transfer coins FROM MetaMask TO the hardware wallet later? Or do I need to buy crypto fresh?",
