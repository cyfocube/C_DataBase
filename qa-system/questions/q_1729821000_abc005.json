  "title": "Is Solana actually faster than Ethereum or just marketing hype?",
  "content": "I keep seeing claims that Solana can do 65,000 TPS while Ethereum does 15 TPS. But when I actually use Solana DApps, they don't feel 4000x faster.\n\n**What I've noticed:**\n- Solana transactions are cheaper (usually)\n- Sometimes Solana network goes down completely\n- Ethereum is more expensive but more reliable\n- Both have congestion issues during NFT drops\n\n**My questions:**\n1. Are the TPS numbers real or theoretical maximums?\n2. Why doesn't Solana feel dramatically faster in practice?\n3. What causes Solana's network outages?\n4. Which chain is actually better for DeFi in 2025?\n5. Is Ethereum 2.0 making this comparison obsolete?\n\nI'm trying to decide where to deploy my DeFi protocol and need real-world insights, not marketing claims.",
