  "content": "This thread is gold! Quick question about the delta-neutral strategy @L2Farmer mentioned:\n\nIf I provide ETH-USDC LP and short ETH perpetual, won't I be paying funding rates on the short position? How do you account for that in the profit calculation?\n\nAlso, what's a realistic funding rate to expect? I've seen some perpetuals charging 10-20% annually in funding which would eat all the farming rewards.",
