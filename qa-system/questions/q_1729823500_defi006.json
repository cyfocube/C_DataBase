  "title": "Convex Finance rewards not claiming - cvxCRV vs CRV confusion",
  "content": "I've been providing liquidity to Curve's 3pool via Convex for 2 months but I'm confused about reward claiming. My current position:\n\n- Deposited: 50,000 3CRV tokens\n- Platform: Convex Finance (for boosted CRV rewards)\n- Current unclaimed: 245 CRV + 89 CVX\n\n**Questions:**\n1. Should I claim CRV directly or convert to cvxCRV for better yields?\n2. What's the current conversion rate CRV â†’ cvxCRV?\n3. Is cvxCRV liquid? Can I sell it back to CRV anytime?\n4. I see options to \"Lock CVX\" for vlCVX - worth it for my position size?\n\n**My understanding:**\n- cvxCRV earns higher APY than regular CRV staking\n- cvxCRV is \"permanently locked\" but tradeable on DEXs\n- vlCVX gives voting power + more rewards but locks CVX for 16 weeks\n\nFor someone with ~$45k in the pool, what's the optimal reward strategy? I'm not a DeFi degen, just want steady yield without getting rekt by complex tokenomics.",
