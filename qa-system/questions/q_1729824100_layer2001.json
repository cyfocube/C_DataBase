  "title": "Arbitrum vs Optimism gas costs - why 10x difference for same transaction?",
  "content": "I'm comparing L2 costs for my DApp deployment and seeing weird gas price differences between Arbitrum and Optimism for identical transactions.\n\n**Same transaction on both networks:**\n- Contract: Simple ERC-20 transfer (100 tokens)\n- From/To: Same addresses (using same private key)\n- Gas limit: 21,000\n- Transaction data: Identical\n\n**Results:**\n- **Arbitrum One**: $0.25 total cost (Gas used: 21,000, Gas price: 0.1 gwei)\n- **Optimism**: $2.47 total cost (Gas used: 21,000, Gas price: 0.001 gwei + L1 fee: $2.45)\n\n**Questions:**\n1. Why is Optimism's L1 data fee so high compared to Arbitrum?\n2. Is this normal or did I configure something wrong?\n3. Which factors affect L1 data costs on each network?\n4. For high-frequency trading bots, which L2 is more cost-effective?\n\n**My understanding:**\n- Both use optimistic rollups\n- Both batch transactions to Ethereum L1\n- Optimism has \"bedrock\" upgrade that should reduce costs\n- Arbitrum uses different compression/batching\n\nFor context: Planning to deploy 100+ transactions daily. At these rates, Optimism costs would be $247/day vs Arbitrum's $25/day. That's a huge difference for essentially the same service.\n\n**Additional data points needed:**\n- Complex contract interactions\n- NFT minting costs\n- Multi-sig wallet operations",
