  "title": "Yearn V3 vault strategy returns negative APY - is this normal?",
  "content": "I deposited 10 ETH into Yearn's ETH vault (yvWETH-0.4.6) three weeks ago and my returns show -2.3% APY. The vault description said \"Low risk, stable returns\" but I'm losing money.\n\n**Vault details:**\n- Strategy: Multi-strategy (Compound, Aave, Convex)\n- Deposits: $2.1M TVL\n- My position: 10 ETH ($16,500 at deposit)\n- Current value: 9.86 ETH ($16,180)\n- Loss: 0.14 ETH (~$230)\n\n**Questions:**\n1. Is negative APY normal for \"stable\" vaults?\n2. Should I withdraw now or wait for recovery?\n3. Are there better alternatives for ETH yield in current market?\n4. How do Yearn strategies actually lose money if they're just lending?\n\nI thought Yearn was supposed to be the \"safe\" DeFi option. Did I pick wrong vault or is this just how DeFi works? New to yield farming and getting worried about my principal.",
