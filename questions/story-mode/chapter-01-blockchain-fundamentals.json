    {

      "question": "What is the primary purpose of blockchain technology?",
      "options": [
        "To replace all traditional databases",
        "To create a decentralized, immutable ledger for trustless transactions",
        "To make transactions faster than traditional payment systems",
        "To eliminate the need for the internet"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Blockchain's revolutionary purpose is to create a decentralized, immutable ledger that allows multiple parties to agree on data without requiring a central authority. Unlike traditional centralized databases, blockchain distributes data across a network of computers, making it resistant to single points of failure and tampering.",
      "detailedExplanation": {
        "concept": "Decentralized Immutable Ledger",
        "keyPoints": [
          "**Decentralization**: No single point of control or failure",
          "**Immutability**: Records cannot be changed once confirmed",
          "**Trustless**: Parties can transact without knowing or trusting each other",
          "**Transparency**: All transactions are publicly verifiable"
        ],
        "realWorldExample": "Think of blockchain like a public ledger book that's photocopied and distributed to everyone in a community. When someone wants to make a transaction, everyone checks their copy to verify it's valid. Once approved, everyone updates their ledger simultaneously. This makes it nearly impossible to cheat because you'd need to change everyone's copy at once.",
        "whyItMatters": "This solves the 'double-spending problem' and eliminates the need for trusted third parties like banks in digital transactions."

      "id": "blockchain-structure",
      "question": "What are the main components of a blockchain block?",
      "options": [
        "Only transaction data",
        "Previous hash, timestamp, transaction data, and current hash",
        "User passwords and account balances",
        "Only the hash of the next block"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Each block contains the previous block's hash (creating the chain), a timestamp, transaction data, and its own hash calculated from all this information.",
      "detailedExplanation": {
        "concept": "Block Structure",
        "keyPoints": [
          "**Previous Hash**: Links to the previous block, creating the 'chain'",
          "**Timestamp**: When the block was created",
          "**Transaction Data**: The actual information being recorded",
          "**Current Hash**: Unique fingerprint of the entire block"
        ],
        "realWorldExample": "Imagine each block as a sealed envelope containing letters (transactions). The envelope has a unique seal (hash) and references the previous envelope's seal. If someone tries to tamper with any letter inside, the seal changes, alerting everyone that tampering occurred.",
        "whyItMatters": "This structure ensures that changing any historical data requires recalculating all subsequent blocks, making tampering computationally expensive and easily detectable."
