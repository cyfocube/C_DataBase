      "detailedResponse": {
        "shortAnswer": "A decentralized, distributed ledger that maintains a continuously growing list of records (blocks) secured by cryptography.",
        "comprehensiveExplanation": {
          "definition": "Blockchain is a revolutionary technology that creates a shared, immutable ledger of transactions distributed across a network of computers.",
          "keyCharacteristics": [
            "**Decentralized**: No single authority controls the network",
            "**Immutable**: Records cannot be altered once confirmed",
            "**Transparent**: All transactions are publicly visible",
            "**Secure**: Cryptographically protected against tampering"
          ],
          "howItWorks": "Each block contains transaction data, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash of the previous block, creating an unbreakable chain. When someone wants to add a new block, the network must reach consensus about its validity.",
          "realWorldAnalogy": "Think of blockchain like a digital ledger book that's photocopied and shared with everyone in a community. Every time someone makes a transaction, everyone updates their copy simultaneously. If someone tries to cheat by changing their copy, everyone else's copies will show the discrepancy.",
          "whyItMatters": "Blockchain enables trustless transactions between parties who don't know each other, eliminating the need for intermediaries like banks or governments."

        "shortAnswer": "To create a decentralized, trustless system for recording and verifying transactions without intermediaries.",
        "comprehensiveExplanation": {
          "primaryPurpose": "Blockchain's main goal is to solve the 'double-spending problem' in digital transactions and eliminate the need for trusted third parties.",
          "problemsSolved": [
            "**Double-spending**: Preventing digital money from being spent twice",
            "**Trust**: Enabling transactions between strangers without intermediaries",
            "**Censorship**: Creating uncensorable, permissionless systems",

          "valueProposition": "By creating a shared source of truth that no single entity controls, blockchain enables new forms of digital interaction and value exchange.",
