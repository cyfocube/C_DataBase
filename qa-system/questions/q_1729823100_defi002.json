  "title": "Compound V3 liquidation bot not profitable - am I missing something?",
  "content": "I built a liquidation bot for Compound V3 but it's barely breaking even after gas costs. Here's my strategy:\n\n1. Monitor undercollateralized positions using Compound's API\n2. Calculate liquidation reward (8% of collateral)\n3. Execute liquidation when profitable\n4. Immediately sell seized collateral on 1inch\n\nProblem: By the time my bot executes, gas costs eat most profits. Current stats:\n- Average gas cost: $15-25 per liquidation\n- Average profit before gas: $18-30\n- Net profit: $3-5 (sometimes negative)\n\nI'm using:\n- Flashloans from Aave to avoid capital requirements\n- MEV protection via Flashbots\n- Optimized contract with assembly for gas efficiency\n\nAm I competing against MEV bots? Should I switch to a different lending protocol? Any tips for profitable liquidations in 2024?",
