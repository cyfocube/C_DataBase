  "title": "Ethereum staking rewards 4.1% APR - worth it vs DeFi alternatives?",
  "content": "Considering staking 32 ETH directly vs using liquid staking or DeFi yields. Current options analysis:\n\n**Solo Staking (32 ETH validator):**\n- APR: ~4.1% (current network rate)\n- Pros: Maximum decentralization, full rewards\n- Cons: 32 ETH minimum, technical setup, slashing risk\n- Liquidity: Locked until Shanghai withdrawals\n\n**Liquid Staking (Lido stETH):**\n- APR: ~3.9% (after 10% protocol fee)\n- Pros: Any amount, liquid, simple\n- Cons: Smart contract risk, centralization concerns\n- Current stETH/ETH: 0.9998 (slight depeg)\n\n**DeFi Alternatives:**\n- Compound ETH lending: ~2.8% APY\n- Curve stETH/ETH LP: ~5.2% APY (but impermanent loss risk)\n- Rocket Pool rETH: ~4.0% APY (more decentralized than Lido)\n\n**My situation:**\n- Available: 35 ETH\n- Risk tolerance: Medium (not comfortable with experimental protocols)\n- Time horizon: 2-3 years\n- Technical skills: Can run validator if needed\n\n**Questions:**\n1. Is solo staking worth the complexity for 0.2% extra APR?\n2. Lido vs Rocket Pool - which is safer long-term?\n3. Any upcoming changes to staking rewards I should know about?\n4. Tax implications different between staking vs DeFi yields?",
